# A NAS for Home Use

Being the sort of a person that has been known to, on occasion, overdo things, I decided a while ago to begin building a NAS for my home use. Why build a NAS in the first place? That lies in what it is and what it can do for you.

## What A NAS Is

A NAS at the basic level provides file serving for a network, but ultimately what it can do is provide a configured server with services from file serving to media, account management, and more. For many people, I wouldn't recommend a full blown NAS configuration, but rather a beefed up computer, configured to act as a server, due to its relative simplicity. At some point, the lines blur and yes, I'm over simplifying, but I'm not going to dive into every possible scenario of configuration here. The bottom line, I recognized the need for multiple machine access, and multiple OS support, ease ofconfiguration, file and media sharing, along with some additional benefits.

## Options For NAS Hosting

Beyond the hardware, and whether you're hosting on a cloud instance or VPS, the choice needs to be made as to what operating system to choose.
