I'm sure that seems like a loaded title. It is, truth be told, but it's also something that I've been thinking about for more than the last decade. Here we are, at what seems to be the pinnacle of the progression of technology's
advancement of our forms of communication, and it also seems that we're at an all-time low for average critical thought and ultimate ability to communicate or debate with each other.

Seeing how I'm not citing any studies, this is a thought piece. It will either reverberate with you and your experiences, or it won't. If anyone is aware of any studies done on the "cultural pulse" of American/western debate and critical thinking, I would welcome it and attempt to reconcile any such information. It must be a well qualified study, of course; not some vapid piece to support a donor faction with obvious biased interest.

People accept things at face value,
