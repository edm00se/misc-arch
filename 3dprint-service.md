# 3D Printing as a Service

Here's the short story, I'm about at the point where I'm ready to start a soft launch of my 3D printing side business. I'm in the process of fleshing out a couple details, such as billing structure and queue handling. I'm also figuring out the specifics of 3d printing adjacent services, such as prototype creation, mold making, and batch production of resin casts or more. There is also the possibility of laser cutting, engraving, or cnc milling.

For now, if you're interested in having something 3D printed, let me know. If you're interested in one of the other above mentioned topics, I'm taking a list of interest. You can fill out the following Google Docs form and I'll get back to you once my queue allows for it. Thanks!
