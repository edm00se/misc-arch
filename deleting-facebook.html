Of late, it has championed the worst parts while the best parts are minimalized, so I find myself at a decision.</p> <p>The Internet itself is a technological achievement, one which all but eliminated barriers, certainly the imposition of physical or political boundaries, and is making great strides in the removal of language barriers. The Internet has excelled in decreasing points of friction, Facebook's management of their platform has shown exactly what little, if any, measures can be taken for removing or disallowing content which is any of foreign attempts at destabilizing elections and the sanctity therein, the inane ramblings or ravings of conspiracy theorists, rabid racism, or the deluded &quot;reasoning&quot; of flat-Earthers or anti-vaccine nuts who are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/30/718220586/is-measles-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing about epidemics<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> which are both entirely avoidable and hallmarks of worse things to come.</p> <p>Some time ago, when the Internet was still becoming mainstream, I heard an anecdote that has stuck with me. It goes to the effect of ~&quot;the Internet is great in that it gives everyone an equal voice; the Internet also gives <em>everyone</em> an equal voice.&quot; As the sharing of junk thoughts and poor reasoning are still worth the &quot;currency&quot; of promoting them over a reason-driven environment, it's no longer something I wish to be a part of.</p> <p>UPDATE: it is done.</p> <h2 id="jumping-ship"><a href="#jumping-ship" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jumping Ship</h2> <p><img src="img/Cyberman_Delete.jpg" alt="Cyberman DELETE"></p> <p>For a while, I've been considering getting rid of my Facebook account. Aside from my news feed generally being full of drivel of various sorts, the only real hold out reasons I have kept my account have been 1. to support a business page of a family member, 2. to maintain connection to some people I don't speak to very often, or 3. retain access to some groups. The fact of the matter is that each of these have become excuses which are holding me back from moving on from Facebook.</p> <p>Some basic realizations come to mind. I don't need to support any pages anymore, as I haven't needed to do anything with them over the last couple years. If I don't speak to people already, what's going to change in the next year? Lastly, we had plenty of group formats before Facebook, so regardless of the convenience of having them on a platform I already had an account on is all the more self-serving in its redundance.</p> <h2 id="why-not-inactivate-instead"><a href="#why-not-inactivate-instead" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why Not Inactivate Instead</h2> <p>I won't be disabling my account, as this does nothing to send the right message to Facebook. Instead I will be deleting my account and its respective content. Aside from having no immediate use, the only reason Facebook has to &quot;give&quot; someone a &quot;free&quot; account is inherent to the form by which they extract their price. The information about and of its users are the currency of Facebook. The situation exposed by the discovery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cambridge Analytica<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> leaks is only the beginning of what is to be a flood in the near future, with few to none at Facebook apparently concerned for the safety, securing, and well being of the respective personal information of its users.</p> <p>Facebook continues to not address the false information, faked (deep or otherwise) content such as videos, blatantly targeted ads that seek to drive people apart, and attempts to influence peoples' opinions and their voting habits. It's not that they can't do anything, they just don't care to. There have been moments when they make statements saying &quot;please regulate us&quot;, but the fact of the matter is they know American politics is so ineffective these days, and politicians so clueless in the ways of technology, that they will never do anything about it.</p> <p>What's more, there has been no &quot;one-off&quot; occurrence of Facebook capitalizing on their acquisition of peoples' information. They've been at it long enough, looking beyond merely advertizing at their users as a source of revenue. What bothers me increasingly is their flaunting of their apparent lack of regulation in the face of Congressional inquiries, but worse their lack of respect for the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/11/599590470/mark-zuckerberg-is-back-before-congress-for-a-second-day-of-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rule of law and authority of our own<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/facebook-contempt-parliament-1.5145347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other respectable nations<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> when they justly seek answers. Zuck has shown he won't properly answer our Congressional leaders' questions without being evasive, at best. This week, failing to appear at Canada's House of Commons panel, instead sending two lackeys in the place of Zuckerberg or Sandberg, after similarly refusing to show in London for a similar body, shows a consistent policy. Avoid and deflect with the expectation of continuing to fleece their cash cow users.</p> <p>To top all of this off, there's the personal toll that something like Facebook elicits. Whether it's our mental health or just plain amount of time in our day, it extracts a certain cost from us. I want my information free from Facebook's clutches and my time back in my day, so that helps make this decision for me pretty easily.</p> <h2 id="a-warning"><a href="#a-warning" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> A Warning</h2> <p>This is it, I won't be posting any more articles or how-tos on how to take care of your personal privacy on Facebook.
