# Announcing: [Awesome Board Games][awesome-bg]!

A side project I've been slowly working on for a while is the [Awesome Board Games list][awesome-bg]. What's an [awesome list][awesome-orig]? It's a list of awesome things, for a particular topic. Generally these lists are hosted/kept on [GitHub][gh], a free to use site and service with code shared via [the git version control system], issue tracking, and more. Anyone can have an account and contribute to public repositories, making it for a great place for open source softare and awesome lists.

## Board Games!

Why? Why not! Board games bring people together, are a great way to interact and spend time with each other. Board games come in a variety of difficulty levels and many can be easily picked up by beginners. Board games come in a wide range of game play styles and most people can find one that suits them, or suits their mood.

## Please Contribute

Anyone can have a GitHub account and anyone can submit board games they think are awesome.
